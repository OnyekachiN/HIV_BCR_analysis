**HIV BCR Analysis**  

This project set out to calculate and visualize B cell receptor variable segment somatic hypermutation frequencies for IgM, IgD, IgG,IgA and IgE antibody isotypes of subjects in a HIV cohort [PMID: 31959979/PMCID: PMC7223457]. Highlighting and comparing key B cell receptor repertoire differences between HIV negative, producers of broadly neutralizing antibodies and non-broadly neutralizing antibody producing participants. 

**Code**  
The code folder contains two files, a python script, and an R script. The python script illustrates how each B cell reads are collapsed to the subject level and each subject’s mutation level is calculated as an average of the subject’s clonal lineage median mutation level. In addition, for each subject the 99th percentile of the most mutated IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE were also calculated. 

The R script visualizes the subject mutation file generated by the python script, highlighting the B cell repertoire differences in HIV negative, noNab, and BNab participants. 

**Figures**  
Subject mutation level frequency boxplot for all isotypes (naïve_a, IgG_a, IgA_and IgE_a). For each subject, the median mutation level for each clone was calculated, averaged, and represented by a dot.
